      "content": "The signs of pregnancy can vary from person to person, and some individuals may not experience any symptoms at all. Common early signs and symptoms include: 1. **Missed Period**: This is often the first indication that someone might be pregnant. 2. **Swollen or Tender Breasts**: Hormonal changes can cause breast tenderness or swelling. 3. **Nausea and/or Vomiting**: Often referred to as \"morning sickness,\" this can occur at any time of the day. 4. **Fatigue**: Increased tiredness is a common symptom due to hormonal changes. 5. **Bloating**: Some individuals may feel bloated early in pregnancy. 6. **Constipation**: Hormonal changes can slow down the digestive system. 7. **Frequent Urination**: Increased need to urinate can occur as the uterus expands. It's important to note that these symptoms can also be related to other conditions, such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS), so the only way to confirm pregnancy is through a pregnancy test. You can take a home pregnancy test or visit a healthcare provider for a test at a clinic (like Planned Parenthood) . If you suspect you might be pregnant, taking a test after your missed period is recommended for the most accurate result. If the test is positive, it's advisable to schedule an appointment with a healthcare provider to discuss your options and ensure your health .",
