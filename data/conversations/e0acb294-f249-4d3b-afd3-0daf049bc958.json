      "content": "Pregnancy occurs when a sperm cell fertilizes an egg, leading to the development of an embryo. Here\u2019s a step-by-step overview of how pregnancy happens: 1. **Ovulation**: About halfway through a woman's menstrual cycle, a mature egg is released from the ovary. This process is called ovulation. 2. **Fertilization**: If sperm is present in the female reproductive tract (typically through vaginal intercourse), one sperm can swim through the cervix and uterus to meet the egg in the fallopian tube. Fertilization occurs when the sperm successfully penetrates the egg. 3. **Formation of the Blastocyst**: After fertilization, the fertilized egg (now called a zygote) begins to divide and grow as it travels down the fallopian tube toward the uterus. This process takes about 3-4 days, resulting in a ball of cells known as a blastocyst. 4. **Implantation**: The blastocyst reaches the uterus and must implant itself into the uterine lining. This implantation typically occurs about 6-10 days after fertilization. Once the blastocyst attaches to the uterine lining, pregnancy is officially established. 5. **Hormonal Changes**: Upon implantation, the blastocyst releases hormones that signal the body to maintain the uterine lining and prevent menstruation, which is why periods stop during pregnancy. It's important to note that sperm can survive in the female reproductive tract for up to six days, meaning that fertilization can occur several days after intercourse, as long as the egg is still viable (which is typically about 12-24 hours after ovulation) (Sources: , , ).

It usually takes about 5 to 10 minutes, but the entire appointment may take longer due to pre-procedure exams and recovery time. During the procedure, you may receive pain medication to help with cramping. The healthcare provider will use instruments to gently remove the pregnancy tissue from your uterus through the vagina. A staff member will be present to support you throughout the process. After the procedure, you will spend some time in a recovery area before leaving. 2. **Medication Abortion**: Often referred to as the \"abortion pill,\" this method involves taking medications to end an early pregnancy (up to 11 weeks after the first day of your last period). It typically involves two medications: mifepristone and misoprostol. The process can cause cramping and bleeding, similar to an early miscarriage. Both methods are considered safe and effective, with in-clinic abortions having a success rate of over 99%, while medication abortions have a success rate of 87-99%, depending on various factors. It's important to discuss your options with a healthcare provider who can provide personalized information and support based on your individual circumstances.
