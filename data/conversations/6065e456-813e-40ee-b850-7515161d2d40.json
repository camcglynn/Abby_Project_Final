      "content": "Preventing sexually transmitted infections (STIs) involves several strategies that can significantly reduce your risk. Here are the key methods for STI prevention: 1. **Abstinence**: The only 100% effective way to avoid STIs is to abstain from all forms of sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex, as well as skin-to-skin genital touching (Planned Parenthood, Source ). 2. **Use of Barriers**: If you choose to have sex, using condoms (external or internal) and dental dams can greatly lower your chances of contracting STIs. These barriers help block the exchange of bodily fluids and reduce skin-to-skin contact that can transmit infections (Planned Parenthood, Source ). 3. **Regular Testing**: Getting tested for STIs regularly is crucial, especially if you have multiple partners or engage in unprotected sex. Early detection allows for timely treatment, which can help you stay healthy and prevent spreading infections to others (Planned Parenthood, Source ). 4. **Communication with Partners**: Open discussions about sexual health and safer sex practices with your partner(s) can foster trust and mutual respect. It\u2019s important to ensure that both partners are on the same page regarding STI prevention (Planned Parenthood, Source ). 5. **Choosing Lower-Risk Activities**: Engaging in sexual activities that are less likely to transmit STIs, such as mutual masturbation or dry-humping with clothes on, can also be safer alternatives (Planned Parenthood, Source ). 6. **Respecting Boundaries**: If a partner is unwilling to use protection or discuss STI prevention, it\u2019s vital to recognize that this may not be a respectful situation. You have the right to prioritize your health and safety (Planned Parenthood, Source ). It's important to note that certain contraceptive methods, such as hormonal implants, patches, or fertility awareness methods, do not protect against STIs. Therefore, combining these methods with condom use is recommended for comprehensive protection (Planned Parenthood, Sources , , ). For personalized advice or concerns about STIs, consider consulting a healthcare provider who can offer tailored guidance based on your specific situation.",

      "content": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It's completely understandable to feel stressed, especially when there may be a lot on your mind. Your feelings are valid, and it's important to take a moment to acknowledge that. Here are a few quick techniques that may help you calm down: 1. **Deep Breathing**: Take a moment to focus on your breath. Try inhaling deeply through your nose for a count of four, holding for a count of four, and then exhaling slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Repeat this a few times, allowing your body to relax with each breath. 2. **Grounding Exercise**: Engage your senses by noticing five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. This can help bring your focus back to the present moment. 3. **Take a Break**: If possible, step away from what you're doing, even if just for a few minutes. Go for a quick walk, stretch, or find a quiet space where you can gather your thoughts. 4. **Listen to Music**: Put on some calming music or your favorite song. Music can greatly affect our mood and help shift our emotional state. 5. **Talk to Someone**: Sometimes, sharing what you're feeling with a friend or loved one can be incredibly relieving. You don\u2019t have to go through this alone. If you find that your stress is persistent or overwhelming, please consider reaching out to a professional who can provide additional support. Remember, it's okay to seek help when you need it. You deserve to feel calm and supported. Take care of yourself.",
